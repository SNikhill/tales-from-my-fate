# [tales from my fate](https://talesfrommyfate.gatsbyjs.io/)

A Personal Website that I bootstrapped using [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
Hosted effortlessly on [Gatsby JS Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/).
I had a certain mindset change and went ahead to create [another](https://github.com/SNikhill/personal-site)
from scratch.

The reason this repository is still up is because, this website helped me experiment with Tailwind CSS and Gatsby.
Yes, the design is neither impressive nor responsive but, at least, I went ahead and tried something.

# Instructions to run Locally

- `npm install`
- `gatsby build && gatsby serve`

# Future

I never went ahead with the design and instead, created
[another website for myself](https://snikhill.tech/) from scratch.
